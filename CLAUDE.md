## Collaboration Rules for Claude

- Prefer minimal, targeted changes and avoid unrelated refactoring.
- After code changes, run the most relevant tests first.
- If unrelated failures appear, report them but do not fix them in the same task.
- Add necessary docs and tests when introducing files/interfaces.
- Response should include: change summary, affected paths, validation steps, and next suggestions.
